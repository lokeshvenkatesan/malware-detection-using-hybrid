# malware-detection-using-hybrid
The open source Android platform allows developers to take full advantage of the mobile operating system, but also raises signiﬁcant issues related to malicious applications.Mobile malware is the highest threat to the security of IoT data, users personal information, identity, and corporate/ﬁnancial information. We considered static, dynamic, and hybrid detection analysis. In this performance analysis, we compared static, dynamic, and hybrid analyses on the basis of data set, feature extraction techniques, feature selection techniques, detection methods, and the accuracy achieved by these methods. Therefore, we identify suspicious API calls, system calls, and the permissions and use them as features to detect mobile malware. This will assist application developers in the safe use of APIs when developing applications for industrial IoT networks. We propose to combine permission and API (Application Program Interface) calls and use machine learning methods to detect malicious Android Apps. In our design, the permission is extracted from each App’s proﬁle information and the APIs are extracted from the packed App ﬁle by using packages and classes to represent API calls. By using permissions and API calls as features to characterize each Apps,we can train a classiﬁer to identify whether an App is potentially malicious or not.
